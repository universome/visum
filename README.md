## TODO

[] Gradient accumulation
[] Albumentations
[] Leave-one-class-out cross-validation
[] Better backbone
[] freeze backbone for training to run faster
[] crop objects from some examples and paste them to other images
[] remove extra parts of the image
[] class dropout, train "any-class" model
[] check why new class prediction does not work: if it RPN or classification
[] Reduce images, because large part of an image is not useful at all
[] Try single-stage detectors
[] Visualize predictions and train data (we would like to see what part of an image can be cropped out)
[] TensorboardX
[] Test-time augmentation
[] Normal ensembling; ensembling models from previous epochs
